*Slicing* - to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by removing one or more rows
*Dicing* - to extract a subset of the data without changing the dimensionality
*Drill down* - increasing the granularity, eg. by looking at months instead of year, region instead of country
*Roll up* - decreasing the granularity, eg by aggregating weeks to months, regions to countries
